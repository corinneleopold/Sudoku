A project that solves a sudoku puzzle for you!

This program takes in a textual representation of an initial board state and initializes a 2D array with that state. It then determines possible candidates for each empty cell and uses 2 common strategies to complete the puzzle. A draw method also creates a visual representation of the board for the user.

Strategies:
1. Naked Singles: cells which have only one possible candidate.
2. Hidden Singles: cells which have a unique candidate for either their box, row, or column.

I have included my test cases for this program.
