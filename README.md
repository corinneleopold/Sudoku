#Sudoku

####*A program that solves a sudoku puzzle for you!*

This program takes in a textual representation of an initial board state and initializes a 2D array with that state. It then determines possible candidates for each empty cell and uses 2 common strategies to complete the puzzle. A draw method also creates a visual representation of the board for the user.
